    A Website, also written as <b> Web site, web site </b>, or simply <b> site </b> , is a set of related web pages served 
    from a single web domain. A Website is hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network
    such as the internent or a private local area network through an Internet address known as a <font color="#FF0000"> Uniform Resource Locator </font>.
    All publicly accessible website collectively constitute the <font color="#FF0000"> World Wide Web </font>.

<p align="justify">
    A webpage is a document, typically written in plain text interspresed with formatting instruction of <font color="#FF0000"> Hypertext Markup Languange </font>
    (<font color="#00FF7F">HTTP,XHTML</font>). A webpage may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors.
</p>
<p align ="justify">
    Webpages are accesed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<font color="#00FF7F">HTTP</font>), which may optionally employ encryption (<font color="#00FF7F">HTTP Secure,HTTPS</font>)
    to provide security and privacy for the user of the webpage content. The user's application, often a web browser, renders the page content according 
    to its HTML markup instructions onto a display terminal.

    The <font color="#FF0000">  World Wide Web </font> (<font color="#00FF7F">WWW</font>) was created in 1900 by CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the <font color="#FF0000"> World Wide Web </font> would be free to use for anyone.

    Before the introduction of HTML and HTTP, other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. 
    These protocols offer a simple directory structure which the user navigates and chooses files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text  files without 
    formatting, or were encoded in word processor formats
